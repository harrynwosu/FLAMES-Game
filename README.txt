To run the program, run "python 3 flamesCode.py"

This is a game that guesses the relationship between two people based on the length of their names. 
At first, the user is prompted for the names of the two people required for the game. This can be only the first name, last name or both as spaces are not counted by the program. Once the user inputs the two required names, the program counts and sums up the number of letters in the two names. 
The program then assigns numbers serially and repeatedly starting from 1 up to this sum to the letters of the word FLAMES. 
The letter which the sum eventually coincides with is the program's guess of the relationship between the two people where: F represents Friends, L represents lovers, A represents Admirers, M represents Married, E represents Enemies, and S represents Secret Admirers.
